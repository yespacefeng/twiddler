# About Me

I'm Ye Feng Chen, a full stack software engineer currently located in upstate New York. I started coding in high school and I stop to focus more on my major. I graduated from Stony Brook University with a BS in Technological Systems Management (Project Management) specializing in computer science. I forgot how enjoyable coding could be. After some deliberation, I decided on a career change to become a software engineer. I want to create something that can be used by everyone.
